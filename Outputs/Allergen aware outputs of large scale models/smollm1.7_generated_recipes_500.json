Make sure you wash both hands thoroughly using soap under running water before handling raw meat or vegetables; this helps prevent cross contamination between surfaces leading towards potential illnesses like salmonella poisoning \u2013 yikes?! It's super important when working closely around hot stoves too... so don't forget about hand washing after touching anything else either way :D !!! Now let me walk through each ingredient used here one by one below \ud83d\ude09 ...*Note:* When buying prewashed veggies such as celery stalks at grocery stores make good decisions since they have already been washed properly thus eliminating chances associated risks posed due improper hygiene practices during harvest seasons where contaminated dirt might still reside within produce itself . So go ahead grab yourself some delicious bell peppers along cucumbers without worrying whether their outer layers were cleaned just yet again right now because no harm done there isn\u2019t really needed anymore even though better quality care taken ensures maximum satisfaction levels achieved afterward once finished eating said meals later tonight anyway ;-) *Final thoughts?
