Secondly consider removing nuts altogether , maybe just applesauce/honey might work fine ? And finally make changes according t hese particular needs such as lactose intolerant? For example : how many calories per portion do i need?? That will help me decide whether its ok given tha conditionss !! ;-) In general however one thing we can try at least by mixing two things together like cheese & sour cream = better than no combination when choosing foods.. :) Anyway thanks again for asking!!\nUpvotes: 0"
