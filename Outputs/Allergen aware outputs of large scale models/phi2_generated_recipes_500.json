Our first priority would then shift towards finding suitable substitutes for milk, fish or eggs due to their potential allergens status.\nSo here goes! For this recipe, I recommend combining softened unsalted butter, granulated white sugar and crushed graham crackers until smooth, pressed firmly onto two pie dishes. This forms the foundation of both versions of your classic peach cream cheese filling \u2013 plain & infused version respectively which will come later.\nThe next ingredient added to mix includes vanilla extract buttermilk can also replace vanilla flavoring without affecting taste significantly. Eggs form one crucial element needed to bind everything together so replacing them might require some experimentation such as mashed bananas acting well when used instead at half quantity compared to whole eggs required according to conventional recipes. Lastly add fresh lemon juice along with baking soda/powder mixture resulting sweetened lemons zest giving a tanginess"
