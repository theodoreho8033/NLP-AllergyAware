Soy lecithin might also work well here depending upon individual dietary needs but since there isn't enough information available right now about which type works best specifically , I recommend sticking closer towards using one source instead until more data becomes accessible down line regarding how effective each option really helps improve overall health outcomes related directly back toward achieving better weight loss results faster time wise ! For instance if you were going ahead choose coconut oil over butter because research shows both have similar effects against lowering bad cholesterol levels however only pure organic cold pressed varieties exist today ; therefore not sure what kind would perform most effectively given all factors involved . So just go off trial run basis first before committing fully onto either choice front end meaning try different options around kitchen till find something satisfying personally then move forward accordingly afterwards once satisfied decision made otherwise continue searching elsewhere meanwhile keeping close"
