# NLP-AllergyAware

Our project aims to develop a personalized
recipe recommendation and generation system
using natural language processing techniques,
with a focus on accommodating food allergies
and promoting healthy-alternatives. By leveraging user preferences, dietary restrictions, available ingredients and kitchenware, we seek to
create an AI-powered assistant that can generate user-tailored recipes. We will be experimenting with different approaches to combine
a large recipe dataset with user reviews to train
a model capable of understanding culinary preferences and food allergens, then generating appropriate recipes. We expect this system to
provide users with personalized, safe cooking
suggestions, while enhancing their culinary experiences.


This repo only contains the project proposal. As we progress through this project I will update this repo with more documents/code.
